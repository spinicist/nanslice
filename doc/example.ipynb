    "One of the key reasons `nanslice` was written was to demonstrate dual-coded overlays, where both color and transparency have meaning - see https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(12)00428-X. To create a dual-coded overlay we specify an 'alpha' or transparency image when creating the `Layer`. In this case we will encode the difference in group T1 (essentially effect-size) as color and the p-value (significance) as transparency. Areas of strong color are hence interesting regions, but we will also be able to see areas with a large effect but low significance which normally would be hidden with a simply thresholded single-coded statistical overlay. Note that now the colorbar has become an 'alphabar', with two meaningful axes. Traditional significance levels can be indicated with a contour. Using this method we see that there are there several areas of T1 change that appear anatomically plausible but do not meet the traditional level of significance after multiple comparisons correction."
